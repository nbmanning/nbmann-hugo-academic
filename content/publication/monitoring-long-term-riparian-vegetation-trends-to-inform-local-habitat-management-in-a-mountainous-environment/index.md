  Riparian ecosystems provide critical habitat for many species, yet assessment
  of vegetation condition at local scales is difficult to measure when
  considering large areas over long time periods. We present a framework to map
  and monitor two deciduous cover types, upland and riparian, occupying a small
  fraction of an expansive, mountainous landscape in north-central Wyoming. 


  Initially, we developed broad-scale predictions of predominant woody vegetation types by integrating Landsat data into species distribution models and combining subsequent outputs into a synthesis map. Then, we evaluated a 35-year Landsat time series (1985–2019) using the Mann-Kendall test to identify significant trends in the condition of upland and riparian deciduous vegetation and assessed the rate and direction of change using the Theil-Sen estimator. Finally, we used plot level data to assess the utility of the framework to detect bottom-up controls (ungulate browse pressure and management actions) on vegetation condition. 


  The synthesis map had an overall correct classification rate of 87% and field data indicated deciduous vegetation within 45 m of coniferous forest faces increased pressure of conifer expansion. The trend assessment identified consistent patterns operating at the landscape scale across both upland and riparian deciduous vegetation; a predominant greening trend was observed for 12 years followed by a 9-year browning trend, before switching back to a greening trend for the last 13 years of the study. 


  Our results indicate trends are driven by the climate of the measurement period at the landscape scale. Although we did not find conclusive evidence to establish a strong link between browse pressure and satellite data, we highlight examples where prevailing trends can be overridden by local disturbance or management intervention. This framework is transferable to other understudied riparian environments throughout western North America to provide insight on ecohydrological processes and assess global and local stressors across broad spatiotemporal scales.

summary: Riparian zones are the areas of vegetation near rivers, streams, and
  other bodies of water. These zones provide habitat for many species and are
  important for the well-being of any ecosystem, yet it’s tough to measure their
  local conditions over long periods of time. We present a combined method to
  track climate’s role on the health of these ecosystems through a species
  distribution model and through measuring the changing trends in a satellite
  data time series.
